About This Release

  Version 0.01 is released at this time just in case I'm
  struck by lightning moments from now.  While not at the
  100% point, Convert::Braille does a good bit and offers
  a starting point for whoever might continue it.

Why Convert::Braille?

  Born out of my own need when working with the visually 
  impaired to translate lingo "Z is 1356" into a meaningful
  character code.  As everyone should be migrating to 
  Unicode, this package offers conversion between ASCII
  encoded Braille and the Unicode specification.

What This Package Can Do

  Convert a string between:

  Braille-ASCII <=> Unicode
  Braille-ASCII <=> Dots
           Dots <=> Unicode

  Unicode here means "UTF-8" encoded text.

What This Package Can NOT Do

  This package can not convert between Braille-ASCII and
  English -which look a lot alike in the alphabetic range,
  but thats about it.  Only character codes are converted,
  no semantic checking is performed.

  Conversion from 8-dot Unicode Braille to Braille-ASCII
  is not handled presently.  This will be fixed later by
  ignoring dots 7 and 8 -or some other solution someone
  suggests.

What Next?

  Fix the 8 dot problem and I intend to work on conversion
  for Braille implementations:

    Convert::Braille::English
    Convert::Braille::Ethiopic
    Convert::Braille::Japanese

  Ethiopic and Japanese both use multi char Braille sequences
  to represent their systems of writing which presents some
  interesting challenges.

  ...and test scripts will be made, the code will be commented,
  the cheque's in the mail...

More Info

  Traditional 6 dot Braille provides 63 printable sequences.
  Few of the Braille fonts I could find on the Internet which
  are supposed to use Braille-ASCII have the full repertoire
  or are compatible with one another.  Very confusing...

  This module was developed with Braille-ASCII information
  presented here:
  
  http://www.uronramp.net/~lizgray/ascii.html
  http://www.cc.utah.edu/~nahaj/ada/braille/braille-ascii.ads.html

  It is also inspired by Convert-Morse-0.03.
